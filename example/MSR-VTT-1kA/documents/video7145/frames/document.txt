Based on the images provided, let's identify the common elements and themes:

1. Both images have the "BBC World News" logo at the bottom, which suggests that these frames are from a news broadcast.
2. The first image shows two individuals sitting in what appears to be a news studio, with one of them likely being the news anchor and the other possibly a guest or correspondent.
3. The ticker at the bottom of the first image mentions a "drugs scandal Operation Puerto," indicating that the news story being discussed or reported on is related to a scandal involving drugs, specifically one referred to as "Operation Puerto."
4. The second image features a close-up of one individual, who appears to be speaking or being interviewed, suggesting that they may be providing insight or commentary on the news topic.

Considering these elements, the consistent message seems to be a news segment covering a drug scandal, with expert analysis or commentary being provided by the guest featured in the second image.

Synthesizing this information, the likely narrative or main topic of the video from which these images are taken is a news report on the "Operation Puerto" drug scandal. The broadcast probably includes an in-depth discussion or analysis of the events, implications, and possibly the outcomes of this scandal, with the guest providing expert opinion or context to the viewers.
