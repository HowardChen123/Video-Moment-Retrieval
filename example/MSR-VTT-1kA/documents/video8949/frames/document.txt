To begin with, the first common element across these images is the presence of water, specifically what appears to be a swimming pool. Notably, a person is featured in many of the frames, and they seem to be engaged in an activity related to the water—likely swimming or diving.

Examining the images more closely, it's clear that the person is underwater in several shots, indicated by the distortion of light and the presence of bubbles. The orientation of the person changes from image to image, suggesting movement through the water. In some frames, the individual appears to be diving or jumping into the water, as evidenced by the direction of movement and the splashes.

Additionally, a couple of images show a view from below, looking up towards what seems to be the underside of a structure or the water's surface. This change in perspective might suggest a focus on the experience of being underwater and the contrast between the subaquatic environment and the world above.

The recurring theme of water and the person's interaction with it—the diving and swimming—suggests that the scene is centered around an aquatic activity, likely for leisure or sport. The images do not show any signs of distress or emergency, implying that the activity is intentional and possibly recreational.

Putting these observations together, the likely narrative is that these images depict a person enjoying a swim or practicing diving in a pool. The repeated frames of the person underwater and the views from below looking up towards the surface convey a sense of immersion in the aquatic environment and the tranquility or exhilaration that comes with such activities. The overarching story these images collectively convey is one of leisure, freedom, and the pleasure of being in water.
