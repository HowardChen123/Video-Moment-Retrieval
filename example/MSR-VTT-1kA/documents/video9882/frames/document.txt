The common elements across these images are the textual overlay at the bottom of the screen which reads "YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT" and the setting, which appears to be a news broadcast with different individuals being interviewed or providing commentary from separate locations labeled as "Central London" and the "Sky News Centre."

The theme of "Youth Unemployment" suggests that the video is likely discussing the challenges faced by young individuals in the job market. The additional text "People aged 16-21 will have to look for jobs for 10 hours a week for benefits" indicates that there is a specific policy or situation being discussed, likely in relation to social welfare or government requirements for young people receiving benefits.

The fact that there are different speakers, presumably from varied backgrounds or with different perspectives, implies that the video might be exploring the topic of youth unemployment from multiple angles, possibly including policy analysis, personal experiences from young individuals, and expert opinions.

Based on these observations, the likely narrative or main topic of the video is a detailed examination of the state of youth unemployment, the impact of specific policies on young people's ability to find work, and the broader social and economic implications. The video may be presenting a debate or a series of interviews to provide viewers with a comprehensive understanding of the issue at hand.
