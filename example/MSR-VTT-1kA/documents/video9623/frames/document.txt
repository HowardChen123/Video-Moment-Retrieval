To infer the overall theme or story from these images, I will begin by noting common elements or recurring themes:

1. The images depict two distinct scenes: one with a man in a suit talking on the phone in a professional setting and another with a man and a woman involved in what appears to be a physical altercation or fight in a more chaotic environment.

2. The man in the suit is seen twice, maintaining the same posture and setting, which suggests a continuous action or conversation happening over the phone.

3. The other images show the man and woman in various states of motion, indicating a dynamic and possibly violent interaction. Their expressions and body language suggest urgency and confrontation.

4. The environment where the man and woman are fighting looks to be a warehouse or some industrial setting, which could imply a clandestine or illegal activity.

Considering these elements, the pattern seems to juxtapose a calm, collected communication in a controlled environment with a tense, physical struggle in a chaotic setting. There is a theme of duality: order versus chaos, calm versus violence.

Based on these observations, the likely narrative or main topic of the scene could be a story involving a crime, espionage, or some form of undercover operation. The man in the suit might be a coordinator or a law enforcement officer managing the situation from a distance, while the man and woman in the other scene could be engaged in a fight related to the unfolding event, possibly trying to escape, defend themselves, or overcome an adversary.

In summary, the overarching story the images collectively convey is one of a high-stakes situation involving conflict and coordination, where individuals in different settings are connected by a common goal or event, be it a struggle for survival or the execution of a complex plan.
